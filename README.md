# LifeSimilator
## 🚀 Life Simulator Game (C# Console App)

Welcome to **Life Simulator**, a C# console-based simulation game where your goal is simple: **survive as long as you can**.  
Random life events—good or bad—come at you, and it's up to you to make the best of them. Can you handle the chaos of life?

### 🧠 About the Project

This is a beginner-level **C# OOP project** built with a modular architecture to practice concepts like:
- Classes & Enums
- Event-driven simulation
- File I/O for save/load system
- Clean code separation across services, models, and events

It's designed to show off my ability to **structure a scalable application** and apply software engineering fundamentals.

### 🎮 How to Play

1. Clone the repo
2. Build and run the project
3. Create your character
4. Survive randomly generated life events
5. Try to beat your previous score by surviving longer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LifeSimulator.git
cd LifeSimulator
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### 🧱 Features

✅ Character creation (name, age, nationality)  
✅ Save/Load system (persists your last game state)  
✅ Dynamic event system (health, job, finance, social life, and more!)  
✅ Car system and job progression  
✅ Random event generator (lottery, sickness, robbery, etc.)  
✅ Console UI feedback with survival stats
### 🔧 Technologies Used

- C# (.NET 8 / .NET Core)
- OOP Principles
- Console Application
- File I/O

### 📁 Project Structure

```bash

├── Enums/             # Enum types like Job, Nationality, Events
├── Events/            # Life, Finance, and Social event logic
├── Models/            # Character, Job, Car models
├── SaveLoad/          # Save/Load system for persistence
├── Services/          # Game services and mechanics
├── Program.cs         # Game loop & main logic
```

### 💡 Future Improvements

- Add GUI (WinForms or WPF)
- More detailed event interactions
- Achievements or stats tracking
- Multiplayer/leaderboard system

### 📣 Why I Built This

I'm learning C# and this project is my way to apply what I’ve learned and demonstrate:
- Clear code organization
- Realistic use of object-oriented design
- Ability to finish and polish a full small-scale game loop

This is my **first complete project**, and I'm proud of the journey so far.
